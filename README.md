# Lua-Snippets

This is a repo of lua code, either that I think is useful or that I have written in a support channel

Please feel free to use the code.
I would like to be credited somewhere in the file and link to this repo.

Benchmarks are for showing which function is quicker
Examples are showing how to do it
Help with random problems is for some code given in a support channel to target hyper specific problems
useful funcs are for some helpful functions or libraries to handle things
